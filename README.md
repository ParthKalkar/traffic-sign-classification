# traffic-sign-classification
In this project, I will use a CNN to build, train and test a traffic sign classification model. I will build this model using TensorFlow and Keras. 

## Scope
This model can be used in self driving cars which will enable them to automatically recognize traffic signs similarly the driver alert system inside cars will help protect dricers by understanding the traffic signs around them.

## Steps
1. Finding Data on Kaggle and laoding it into Google Colab.
2. Preprocessing the images and visualizing them.
3. Finding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all images accordingly. 
4. Comverting the images into a numpy arrray and normalize them. 
5. Checking class imbalance.
6. Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding.
7. Creating the model architecture, compiling the model and then fitting it. 
8. Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch. 
9. Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it. 
10. Visualizing the original and predicted lables for the test images.
